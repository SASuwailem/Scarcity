# Scarcity
A model of managing resources during the time of Prophet Yusuf (Joseph), peace be upon him
We apply a simple Lagrangian optimization model to compute the trajectory of savings during abundance and famine during the time of Prphet Yusuf (peace be upon him) as resported in the Quran (12:43-49)
There are two files:
1. A short paper explaining the model
2. Wolfram Mathematica code to plot the graphs.
